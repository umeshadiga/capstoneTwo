There are approximately 50 such CSV files recording the channel hole features where images are collected under different protocols. Dr. Umesh Adiga is made aware of different protocols used and the corresponding data sets. We will work with him to clear any confusion.
We would like to know what particular set of data shows the best "Gauge R&R" and corresponding imaging and processing protocls. We would also like to know how the image resolution plays a rold in calculation of features and the Gauge R&R. Corresponding CSV files for multiple resolutions are provided for this analysis.
